Platform: TI-86

Info: Alien Invasion 2 is a sequal to my first game Alien Invasion.
My friends and I have enjoyed this game for a long while, so I decided
to publish it. It's my first published game!Alien Invasion 2is like a 
Space Invaders game, shoot down the aproaching ships. There are only 
two ships on the screen at one time.

Controls:
2nd - Shoot
Alpha - Pause
Left Arrow - Move left
Right Arrow - Move right
Exit - Exit

Bugs: No actual bugs, but when you shoot, everything stops until the
shooting sequence is over.

Legal Stuff: All I ask is that you don't put your name on it and say 
that you made it.
